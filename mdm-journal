Oct 10 - morning (can't remember exact timing)
----------------------------------------------
I have actually begun the project! It was a bit later than I intended because of the overlap between my previous postdoc position and this new one but I am very excited to get it going to be able to have tangible things to begin sharing with the rest of the GaR group. 

Trying to think about research questions and objectives for the future, I will have to start thinking about what unnecessary elements I want to remove from the default CollectionBuilder-GH template and what new things I want to add or customize. I definitely will not need the map functionality though the timeline function could be useful. I should start to also think about the aesthetics of the site, as it will be easier to present and persuade people to use it if it looks nice/slick/sexy.

I have also begun watching more tutorial videos on GitHub and CollectionBuilder and am planning on watching more related to Jekyll, static web design, HTML, JAVA, and CSS as well to assist with the overall design.

I believe the first two collections I will be working on are the Steam Reviews and the demakes.

I also need to start thinking about how I want to brand this and if it is going to more of a Thorson archive or a Celeste archive.
